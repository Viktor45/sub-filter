# Code of Conduct

## Our Promise

We, the members, contributors, and leaders of this project, promise to make everyone feel safe and welcome—no matter your age, background, appearance, identity, experience level, or beliefs.

We’re committed to building a community that is kind, respectful, inclusive, and supportive for everyone.

## What Good Behavior Looks Like

✅ Be kind and understanding  
✅ Respect people who think or act differently than you  
✅ Give helpful feedback—and accept it gracefully when it’s given to you  
✅ Own up to mistakes, say sorry when needed, and learn from them  
✅ Think about what’s best for the whole community, not just yourself

## What’s Not Okay

❌ Sexual language, images, or unwanted attention of any kind  
❌ Insults, name-calling, or personal attacks  
❌ Trolling, bullying, or being mean in public or private  
❌ Sharing someone’s personal info (like their email or address) without permission  
❌ Any behavior that would be considered unprofessional or inappropriate in a respectful setting

## Who’s in Charge?

Project maintainers are responsible for keeping this space safe.  
If someone breaks this code, they may:
- Remove or edit comments, code, or issues
- Explain why a post or action was problematic
- Take fair action to protect the community

## Where This Applies

This code applies everywhere we work together—like GitHub, chat rooms, and forums.  
It also applies when you’re representing the project publicly, such as:
- Using an official email
- Posting from a project social media account
- Speaking at an event as a community member

## How to Report a Problem

If someone is being hurtful, harassing, or acting inappropriately, please report it.  
You can do this by opening an issue in the repository or contacting the maintainers directly.

All reports will be:
- Taken seriously  
- Reviewed quickly and fairly  
- Kept private to protect the reporter

## What Happens If Rules Are Broken?

We follow these steps when someone doesn’t follow the code:

### 1. **Gentle Reminder**  
**When:** Someone uses unkind or unprofessional language.  
**What happens:** A private message explaining what went wrong. You might be asked to apologize.

### 2. **Official Warning**  
**When:** A clear violation—even if it only happened once.  
**What happens:** You’ll get a warning and be asked to stop interacting with certain people or spaces for a while. Breaking this rule again could lead to a ban.

### 3. **Temporary Ban**  
**When:** Repeated or serious bad behavior.  
**What happens:** You won’t be allowed to participate (publicly or privately) for a set time. Any contact during this time may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. **Permanent Ban**  
**When:** A pattern of harmful behavior, harassment, or discrimination.  
**What happens:** You’ll no longer be allowed to take part in the community.
